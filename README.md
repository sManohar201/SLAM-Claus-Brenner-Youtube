# SLAM-Claus_Brenner-Youtube
This repository contains solution for SLAM lectures taught by Claus Brenner on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2qzYCeT9oQ&list=PLpUPoM7Rgzi_7YWn14Va2FODh7LzADBSm&ab_channel=ClausBrenner).

## Updates
1) In addition to the cylinder based features for map correspondence I have also added corner based features for map correspondences.
2) I have added Unscented Kalman Filter Loacalization in addition to the extendend kalman filter taught in the course. 

## Requirements
- Python 2
- Matplotlib
- Pylab

It is best to have either Anaconda or miniconda installation on your system, as it should satisfy all the requirements by default.
